## About the project

This page was made for the "Etch-a-Sketch" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

The page was meant to showcase the DOM manipulation skills learned so far.

The page was built using CSS for styling, HTML for structure and Javascript for dynamic features.

You can test the demo [here.](https://jgoldenusr.github.io/3.Etch-a-Sketch/)
